so this is an unboxing and brief review

of the new light foam I first heard

about this phone on Kickstarter and I

placed an order probably the better part

of a year ago and I just received it

within the last few days the company

website has a lot of information about

the philosophy of the phone but just for

people who aren't familiar with it

I'll mention that you know the idea is

for to have sort of a minimalist phone

this doesn't get on the internet it

doesn't allow you to send receive emails

can't send text messages no photographs

no video the idea is basically you make

calls and you receive calls and if

somebody can't reach you they leave a

voicemail if you can't remember their

number they're probably not worth

calling now I joke there because they're

I think there is a feature where you can

store ten different speed dial numbers

but it's a pretty light phone no pun

intended there aren't a whole lot of

features it's designed to be very small

very compact very lightweight and to

supplement maybe a more standard smart

phone so I've actually already unboxed

the package here and sorry to spoil that

surprise and it comes in a booklet form

like this so you get it and it actually

looks like a book and actually as pages

like a book which is interesting and I

think this goes with their minimalist

aesthetic you know for the marketing

campaign nothing really in Paros is in

some photographs and you flip through it

essentially I'll cut to the end here

when you get to the back you've got this

and there's the phone then it comes with

a charging cable that's it that's all

you get inside now it originally came

with a little piece of plastic over the

front and all the plastic had on it was

numbers and then a series of numbers at

the top representing I think it was the

time not a song number but the time so I

peeled that off and what you're left

with is this

and I'll turn it on in the minute so you

can actually see the display but when

it's off notice that you can't see any

numbers and there's just nothing it

looks like a kind of a thick white

credit card on the back it's very faint

you can't really read it but it says

light now the switches on here is best

I've been able to determine both by

using it and by looking at the brief

instruction booklet which I'll show you

in a minute it's just a one sheet

instruction page this is the power

button on top this is of course the

earpiece of the headphone speaker if you

will on the side here is a lock button

that seems that that's all that does

over here is where you insert your SIM

card and then at the bottom here you've

got your microphone and you've got your

micro USB port so that's basically about

it now I'll go ahead and turn the phone

on so you can see the display and this

is interesting it lights up you can see

at the top it says log I'll turn the

lock feature off and you can see that as

I'm filming this it's 8:12 let's see if

I can get that to come back on again so

you can see there the digits there on

the display plus you can see the buttons

I'll turn that back on again it turns

turns itself off to save power but this

button here would be your green button

your send button or answer button and

then over here would be hang up or you

know delete if you're in the middle of a

function now the instruction book that

it comes with is actually just one sheet

it's just got sort of a layout there and

on the back it's got some information on

how it functions it's pretty

straightforward overall when I found in

using it over the last 24 hours is that

the sound quality is excellent it's

essentially on par with regular modern

smartphones doesn't sound any better but

certainly doesn't sound any worse if

you're familiar with the Samsung s7 HD

audio feature look if you were to call

somebody else with a Samsung phone

you're going to have better sound

quality obviously than you will with

this

but that that feature is you know it's

sort of the exception most of the modern

cellphone time about the same sound

quality so this one sounds very good

this is very lightweight something that

I like about it quite a bit it's about

probably half the size of some of the

smaller cell phones it's in the market

and it's got a nice feel to it the

plastic doesn't feel cheap there's no

metal really on the outside of it then I

mean these jacks so you know it's not

making use of the glass and the metal

that you're seeing on most smartphones

today but the plastic does feel like a

good plastic it's only two things that I

found so far using it that I don't

really like one is that when you go to

use the phone these numbers are pretty

clear especially if it's not you know

you're not out in broad daylight these

numbers are up here can be very

difficult to read when I called myself

yesterday had my wife called me and I

called her the phone number at the top

is difficult to read and I think it

would be impossible to read if you were

out in sunlight the bottom I haven't had

any trouble with that even really bright

light you know looking at the numbers at

the bottom and they do make a black

version of this phone so I think that if

you've got the black version it might be

a little bit easier because there'd be

some contrast the second thing that I

don't like about the phone is I'm

concerned that you may not be able to

use it the future it's using 2g and most

phone services are phasing 2g out if

they haven't already and so I'm not sure

how long I'll be able to use the phone

quite honestly I ordered it you know

about a year ago just finally received

it I won't lie I'm excited to receive it

and it was worth the wait

it's very cool I like the styling and I

like the attention to detail they put

into it but because it's been in

development so long the phone system

that they thought you know would be

appropriate at the time maybe a phone

system that we're not going to have for

much longer

so I do hope they come out with some

sort of update I haven't kept kept up to

speed with whether or not they've got a

fix for that but that's one concerned

you're looking to buy this there is one

of the things I'll just mention about

the phone is I haven't figured out how

to do this yet apparently there's a way

for you to take your SIM card from your

cell phone insert it in here and then

sort of use this as a surrogate for your

main phone so rather than having a

separate telephone number everybody has

to memorize to call you on you would you

would swap this phone out like if you

were going to you know going on vacation

or your relaxing for the weekend you

want to have this very simple like phone

with you you put your SIM card in here

forget your troubles with regard to

email text messages in Facebook and then

you carry this around for the weekend I

haven't figured out I do that it may

just be as easy as popping the SIM card

in but it looks like from their

instructions you're supposed to go

online set it up and it's a little more

involved probably doesn't take very long

but it's I don't think it's as easy as

just inserting the card another thing

I'll mention about that same topic is

when I got the phone and I was excited

to charge it and try it right on the box

I was able to make calls right away I

didn't have to do any setup I just

turned the phone on I called my cell

phone number my main cell phone and it

rang I did one phone in each year you

know it sort of did a little test then I

had my wife called me and I called her

and it had a New York

cell phone number which I don't know if

it's somebody else's I don't know how it

work I'm just telling you it worked and

so right out of the box I could start

making calls I'm not sure who's getting

charged for those calls you know there

is something an instruction manual that

says that it can be a standalone phone I

have to read more about that because I'm

not sure I just don't understand that

how basically I started using the phone

yesterday without any setup I'm not

complaining it's kind of cool because

right on the box and you're excited to

try it out but I didn't recognize the

phone number and like I said you know

I'm going to Oregon here and it was a

New York

cell phone number I think the company's

based on a Brooklyn so maybe they just

give you a phone number that works from

the New York area so overall I'm

impressed with the phone I think it's

interesting idea I understand it's not

going to be for everybody I think if I

was going to design the phone you know I

would made sure that it works for 3G I

probably would have figured out a way to

I would better display at the top

because like I said that's pretty fuzzy

I do like the numbers down at the bottom

and the fact that when it's powered off

it's just a white blank flight I think

that said it because they're appealing

for a phone like this I just wish that

his blade up top was a little sharper

but overall I like it if given the

chance again

I would buy another
